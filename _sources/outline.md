# Outline

## Figure Panels

- Some kind of expository figure
  - show a very small graph matching problem
  - show that even in this simple setting, there are ties in (1)
  - somehow represent the sinkhown solution as a convex combination of the solutions above 
- Figure 1 from FAQ: Timing GM vs GMOT
  - same simulation as that setting
  - additional line with the new code
  - n can be bigger than in the original code
- Figure 4 from FAQ: FAQ vs GMOT on QAPLIB
  - objfunc
  - time
  - # vertices
  - basically pairplots for the 3 above
- Figure kinda like SGM figure 2 one
  - rho-SBM for increasing rho, differently sized graphs
  - maybe/maybe not with seeds
- Some kind of figure on SoftSGM/vertex nomination
  - figure 5 or 7 from SGM
- Real data: hopefully maggot
  - need to figure out why match ratio was lower but objfunc value was higher

## Code
- solvers that give access to the permutation matrices/gradients along the way
